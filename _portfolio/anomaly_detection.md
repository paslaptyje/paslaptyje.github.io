## Project Overview

This projected focused on identifying early fault signals in industrial bearings using vibration data.

### Key Results

*   Achieved 95% accuracy in fault classification.
*   Reduced false alarm rate by 15%.

## Methodology

We utilized a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the CWRU dataset.
